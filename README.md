## Description:

BlogMate is a blogging platform where users can sign up, create blog posts, and view other users' content. The application uses PostgreSQL for data storage, Node.js for backend development, React for the frontend interface, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The application is built using the Hono app framework and uses Wrangler for deployment.

## Features:

1. **Signup and Signin Pages:**
   - Users can create an account or log in with existing credentials.

2. **Publish Page:**
   - Authenticated users can create and publish new blog posts.
   - A `TextEditor` component allows users to write their content.
   - Posts include a title and body content, which are then stored in the PostgreSQL database.
   - Upon publishing, users are redirected to view their blog post.

3. **Blogs Page:**
   - Displays a list of all available blog posts.
   - Each blog post is represented by a `BlogCard` component.
   - If data is still loading, skeleton loaders (`BlogSkeleton`) are shown.

4. **Blog Page:**
   - Displays the full content of a single blog post.
   - Uses the `FullBlog` component to render the blog details.
